Special Thanks:

I would like to thank the LKS community for encouraging me to complete this project and a special thanks to Amiiban, Deadweight, Azeribeltza, and iwubcode, each for their technical help.

Description:

This mod sets out to fully reimagine the progression from Onii Man until Onii King. It takes about an hour or two to play through although I recommend starting from a fresh save. Also, unfortunately, it is only possible in English because of localization issues. This was a project I started sometime during 2022 or 2023. Honestly it kind of became a joke because of how immpossible it seemed. but after years of effort, it is ready. Hopefully you enjoy playing it or watching someone else's perspective.

Installation:

This is a Riivolution Mod so disregard installation if you know how to already.
  1.  Move the "LKS New Alpoko" folder into the "Riivolution" folder in Dolphin.
  2.  Move the "LKSDarkValleyRedux.xml" file into the "riivolution" folder in Dolphin.
  3.  In Dolphin, right click your LKS ROM and choose "Start with Riivolution Patches"
  4.  ???
  5.  Profit!


Compatability:
This is the largest LKS mod to date with several features. nearly every useful file is modified, so it will not be compatible with nearly any mod. Saves will be in their own directory so will not effect normal LKS, but upon first load all of your normal LKS saves will be copied over.
