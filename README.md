Installation:
This is a Riivolution Mod so disregard installation if you know how to already.
  1.  Move the "LKS New Alpoko" folder into the "Riivolution" folder in Dolphin.
  2.  Move the "LKSDarkValleyRedux.xml" file into the "riivolution" folder in Dolphin.
  3.  In Dolphin, right click your LKS ROM and choose "Start with Riivolution Patches"
  4.  ???
  5.  Profit!
Compatability:
This is the largest LKS mod to date with several features. nearly every useful file is modified, so it will not be compatible with nearly any mod. Saves will be in their own directory so will not effect normal LKS, but upon first load all of your normal LKS saves will be copied over.
